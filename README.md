# ðŸ§  NeuroAdaptive Intelligence Infrastructure

**A Personal Cognitive Infrastructure for Neurodivergent Humans.**
An agentic, privacy-first Cognitive Operating System designed to dynamically orchestrate the digital environment for professionals with ADHD, Autism, and Dyslexia â€” now featuring **NEXUS**, a therapeutic gaming platform for dyslexic children.

---

## ðŸ›‘ The Problem Statement & The Reality Gap

There is a **$1.2 Trillion neurodiversity productivity gap** in the global economy. Modern enterprise tools and workplaces are fundamentally built for neurotypical cognition. They demand constant context-switching, rely on implicit subtext, and bombard users with visual noise. For neurodivergent professionals, this environment causes severe executive dysfunction, masking fatigue, and inevitable burnout.

**The Cognitive Crash Scenario:**
Imagine an Autistic or ADHD software engineer deep in a state of hyperfocus. Suddenly, a vague Slack message arrives: *"Can we talk about the Jira ticket?"* Instantly, Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) spikes. They switch contexts to Jira, which is visually overwhelming and poorly structured. Working memory fails as they try to remember what was promised in last week's thread. The friction of decomposing the vague request into actionable steps is too high. Paralysis sets in. A highly capable mind crashesâ€”not from a lack of skill, but from a hostile digital environment.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Existing Solutions vs. Our Innovation

**The Fragmented Status Quo:**
Current "accessibility" tools are drastically insufficient.
- Standard OS features only offer superficial UI tweaks (font sizes, dark mode).
- Point solutions like Otter.ai or Goblin Tools are fragmented, requiring users to manually copy/paste text back and forth, breaking flow state.
- Corporate accommodations require medical disclosure, forcing employees to undergo stigmatizing HR processes just to function.

**The NeuroAdaptive Innovation:**
We do not treat neurodivergence as a deficit to be fixed; we treat it as a **cognitive variation to be amplified**.
Our OS provides real-time cross-app orchestration combined with zero-disclosure dignity. Users do not need a medical diagnosis. The OS uses local edge-ML to silently read biometric stress, deploying AI agents directly into Jira and Slack via a shadow DOM extension to sanitize the environment before the user becomes overwhelmed.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Value Proposition (What is the Use of Our Application?)

The NeuroAdaptive OS acts as a **Real-Time Cognitive Co-Processor**. It serves as an invisible buffer between the user and the corporate world. It proactively shields focus, translates passive-aggressive or vague communication into clear action items, offloads fragile working memory into a vector database, and predicts/prevents burnout automatically based on biometric telemetry.

---

## ðŸ§© NEXUS Kids Module (Therapeutic Gaming Platform)

A fully integrated therapeutic gaming engine designed for **dyslexic children aged 3â€“18**. Uses Google Gemini AI to generate real-time, age-calibrated educational content â€” zero hardcoded questions.

### ðŸŽ® Dynamic Age-Based Game Generation
- **AI-First Content**: When a game loads, the frontend sends the child's age to the backend `/generate-game-content` route, which prompts Gemini 2.0 Flash to generate developmentally appropriate questions.
- **Two Game Modes**:
  - **Crack the Quiz**: Multiple-choice emotion/knowledge quiz with per-answer coloring, speech feedback, and canvas-confetti celebration.
  - **Drag & Spell**: Missing-letter spelling puzzle with drag-and-drop mechanics and speech synthesis hints.
- **Age Gate**: If a child navigates directly (without a parent profile), a full-screen "How old are you?" prompt collects their age before generating content.
- **Automatic Fallback**: If Gemini is unavailable, games fall back to Supabase seed data â€” the child never sees an error.

### ðŸ“¸ Real-Time Biometric Capture
- **Webcam Frame Capture**: During gameplay, the `useCapture` hook takes video frames every 10 seconds and uploads them to Supabase Storage (`kids-captures` bucket).
- **DOM Screenshot Capture**: Full-page screenshots via html2canvas for post-session analysis.
- **Expression Tracking Ready**: Infrastructure is in place to pipe frames through the local MediaPipe vision engine for real-time expression logging.

### ðŸ‘¨â€ðŸ‘©â€ðŸ‘§ Dual-Portal System
| Portal | Description |
|---|---|
| **Parent Dashboard** | Manage child profiles (create/view). Each child card has "Play Quiz" and "Play Spelling" launch buttons that pass `childAge` to the game for AI calibration. Form auto-collapses when children exist; auto-opens for first-time parents. |
| **Teacher Dashboard** | Full analytics suite with Recharts visualizations: session history, emotion distribution (RadialBarChart), per-emotion averages (BarChart), and scrollable game session cards with embedded screenshot galleries. |

## ðŸš€ How to Use / Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Clone the repository and set up your keys. You need **two** environment files:

**`/server/.env`** (Backend):
```env
PORT=3000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_byte_hex_string
```

**`/.env.local`** (Frontend):
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Supabase Setup (CRITICAL)

1. **Run Migrations**: Execute `supabase/migrations/init.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor to create all tables.
2. **Kids Module Tables**: Execute `supabase/merge_kids_module.sql` for the game session and child profile tables.
3. **Storage Bucket**: In the Supabase Dashboard, navigate to **Storage â†’ Create Bucket** and create a bucket named `kids-captures` (set to **Private**). Then run `supabase/fix_storage_bucket.sql` to apply RLS policies allowing authenticated uploads.

4. **Storage Cleanup (Edge Function)**: The physical deletion of expired captures is handled by a Supabase Edge Function. To trigger this daily in production, use the Supabase Cron (`pg_net`) via SQL:
   ```sql
   select cron.schedule('storage-cleanup-daily', '0 0 * * *', $$
     select net.http_post(
       url:='https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/functions/v1/storage-cleaner',
       headers:=jsonb_build_object('Content-Type', 'application/json', 'Authorization', 'Bearer your-service-role-key')
     ) as request_id;
   $$);
   ```
   *Note: If your Supabase instance pauses due to free-tier inactivity, we have included a GitHub Actions failover workflow (`.github/workflows/coppa-cleaner.yml`). To enable it, navigate to your GitHub Repository Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions, and add `SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTION_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.*

### 3. Booting the Infrastructure

**Start the backend orchestration layer:**
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Start the Vite React client** (in the project root):
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Loading the Chrome Extension

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Toggle **Developer mode** ON (top-right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `/extension` directory from this repository
4. The extension icon should appear in your toolbar â€” it will automatically inject NeuroAdaptive UI into supported pages

### 5. The User Journey

1. **Zero-Disclosure Onboarding**: Create an account. No medical diagnosis required. Set your sensory preferences.
2. **Permissions Gate**: The OS will politely request camera/mic access for edge-ML calculation (all processed locally).
3. **The Dashboard**: View your live Cognitive State Orb, Live Stress Panel, and Burnout Forecast.
4. **Trigger an Agent**: Paste an overwhelming block of text into the Communication Translator or use the Momentum Architect to break down a paralyzing task.
5. **Cross-App Sync**: Open a mocked Jira or Slack instance and watch the Manifest V3 extension inject the NeuroAdaptive UI natively into the page.
6. **Kids Module**: Navigate to the Parent Dashboard â†’ Create a child profile â†’ Launch a game. Watch Gemini generate age-calibrated questions in real-time.

---

## ðŸš¨ Hacks & Demo Modes (Judges Only)

### The Simulated Demo Trigger
Biometric data takes days to become predictive. During the live pitch, navigate to the Dashboard and press **`Ctrl + Shift + D`**.

This hidden hook instantly bypasses the ML lock, injects 7 days of realistic mathematical telemetry directly into Supabase, and forces the Recharts/UI to dynamically explode with data, bleeding the orb from **Green** (Optimal) to **Red** (Overload).

### Slack/Jira Demo Mode
On the Dashboard, the **Workspace Integrations** panel shows mock Slack and Jira notifications. Click **"Simplify with AI"** to watch Gemini rewrite stressful corporate messages into calm, neurodivergent-friendly instructions in real-time.

### Kids Module Quick Test
1. Navigate to `/kids/quiz` directly in the URL bar
2. The "How old are you?" age gate will appear
3. Enter any age (3â€“18) and click "Let's Play! ðŸš€"
4. Watch Gemini generate custom questions calibrated to that exact age
